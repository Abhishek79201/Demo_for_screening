## Do you find any specific browser more challenging to work with than others, and how do you resolve browser compatibility issues?

` I find Safari a bit challenging to work with sometimes. It behaves differently from other browsers, and some CSS features may cause layout issues.

Staying updated with browser specifications and best practices helps me tackle these compatibility issues effectively.`
